# Loving Annabelle English Subtitles
  
I read here that some people wondered if Mother Immaculata sexually abused Simone when she was a student... When I first watched the movie last night, I thought that too... but after thinking some more and watching the movie again today, I'm not sure if it was necessarily sexual, but Mother Im definitely had a controlling and mentally abusive relationship with Simone. 

When the priest was sitting next to Simone in the priest and recalled the story from when she and Amanda ran off with the wine, Simone said, "You knew that was us?" He tenderly replied, "my problem is that I know everything".... Simone and he smiled at each other, and then he comfortingly took her hand. I think his means he knew that she and Amanda were in love.

I believe that Mother Immaculata knew this as well, and did everything in her power to pull them apart while they were in school. Hence, her statement, "That shouldn't be difficult, Simone. I was able to control YOU." To Simone that may mean, "yeah, you ruined my life". But to Mother Immaculata, it means, "I kept you in line. You should do the same with Annabelle."

Maybe Mother Immaculata's interference in Amanda and Simone's relationship is why Simone left the school after she graduated, as she told Annabelle. Maybe she and Amanda ran off to be together after they both graduated. And maybe Simone only returned to the school to teach to be near the memory of Amanda.

We don't know where their relationship went from there or why Amanda committed suicide... 

FYI
Her letter to Simone:

S- 
I know you will not understand why I did this, but one day I hope you can forgive me...and soon forget me. 
I've tried to find happiness, but darkness seems to find me and I can't breathe. 
You were always the strong one. 
I'm sorry. 
-A 


Perhaps Amanda had tremendous guilt, growing up Catholic, and loving a woman. Maybe Mother Immaculata had immense control over Amanda as well and made her feel this guilt. Who knows the reasons that Amanda never found true happiness within herself as her letter states.

We also don't know what exactly Simone's parents felt so "guilty" about. Guilty enough to give her that beach house as Simone said. Was she referring to typical "Catholic guilt" that so many people speak of growing up raised in that religion? Maybe they thought it was their fault that their daughter's love was now dead. Or felt like they ruined their daughter by putting her through that school with that controlling woman, Mother Immaculata. Maybe that's why Simone "doesn't see her parents much" as she said to Annabelle. Or maybe her parents never accepted Simone and Amanda either.

Either way, Mother Immaculata's role in the film is definitely one of control and dominance. When Simone sat in her office, before the police officers showed up, she said to Mother Immaculata, "I don't expect you to understand. You never.." And didn't finish her sentence.

To me, Simone's face through that whole scene was just disbelief and disgust in Mother Immaculata. It seemed that Simone had finally gotten the strength to stand up to her, even though the scenario didn't allow for her to say or do much. She seemed stronger walking out of that building.

I do believe it's possible that Mother Immaculata represses her own sexual desires, some of which may possibly be for women. I think this may explain the scene where she is drinking and touches Simone's hair. Perhaps this attempt has happened before. But I think most likely, Simone is just fed up and dislikes Mother Immaculata, and therefore storms out of the room. 

I bet that their relationship has more to do with Mother Immaculata stepping in and keeping Amanda and Simone from being together. Any kind of true love, she stomps down.

What do other folks think about Mother Immaculata?

"Either way, Mother Immaculata's role in the film is definitely one of control and dominance. When Simone sat in her office, before the police officers showed up, she said to Mother Immaculata, "I don't expect you to understand. You never.." And didn't finish her sentence."

I didn't know what Simone said to Mother Immaculata. So, I went to the subtitles and Simone said to Mother Immaculata, "I don't expect you to understand...but I love her."

My thoughts: Maybe Mother Immaculata got jealous of Simone and Annabelle.
 
i came on these msg boards exactly for this topic.
and srsly, i thought this movie was trying to insinuate that mother im had sexually abused simone.. and that really upset me!
it perpetuates the stereotype that all gay ppl have been sexually abused to have become gay.
but now, seeing it from your perspective, i can say that you may be absolutely right.
she may not have sexually abused simone and is just a controlling woman who may have WANTED to sexually abuse her...
whatever the case may be, i think most ppl will come to the conclusion of sexual abuse here.
and that sends a terrible msg.
i really did not like that part of this movie at all.
i mean, i also didn't appreciate the ending, but wow... this is a terrible thing to put in ppl's minds.

A court of law in Ontario, Canada certainly considers this type of situation to be abuse and inappropriate: -sun.html

That case almost sounds like it could have been the inspiration for this film.
 
i dont like her shes alcoholic creepy and catholic very homophobic shes insane. she has mood swings. a hypocrite. i wish she didnt look so witchy. annabelle didnt deserve to even go to that school under that psychos ruling. simone shouldve quit to be free of her and to be with annabelle without the authorities finding out
